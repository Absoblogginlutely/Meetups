## Automating AD Healthchecks with PSADHealth toolkit

Synopsis:
Mike Kanakos is a senior sysadmin & Active Directory engineer for Lord Corporation in Cary, NC and is responsible for keeping a global AD infrastructure online and running optimally. Mike is also a regular PowerShell community blogger and speaker at this year's PowerShell summit (2019) in Seattle, Washington as well as co-lead of the Raleigh-Triangle PowerShell users group.


Mike wanted to fill in the gaps that his monitoring tools weren't able to cover, so he started to write his own toolset to help keep an eye on some of the core components of Active Directory. This talk highlights his toolkit, [PSADHealth](https://github.com/compwiz32/PSADHealth), which uses automated jobs to regularly check the core services and functions of AD and alert you in real time using nothing more than PS Scripts, email and other off the shelf tools.
