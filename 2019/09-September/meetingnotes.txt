Mark Kraus wrote a module for BetterTLS

https://github.com/markekraus/bettertls
from brett miller to everyone:
AutoRest is really good for API's if they stick to the OpenAPI spec. Few using the spec, fewer sticking to the specification :)
from brett miller to everyone:
I'd advocate for using the correct naming convention so that you don't have to skip PSSA checks
from brett miller to everyone:
You will get PSSA warnings otherwise
from David Kirchmer to everyone:
We use several powershell scripts that populate several "Controls Reports" related to security items such as AV Compliance.  Those scripts are currently signed to prevent tampering with the code but Private/Public sounds like another means of preventing modifications to the critical sections related to the "Control"

Start-job creates a background job on the local computer
from StevenJ to everyone:
What do you do if the servers are not divisible by 10?
from brett miller to everyone:
using the -AsJob or Invoke-Command runs it on the remote machine
from Jonathan Moss to everyone:
Except for PowerCLI :(
from Jonathan Moss to everyone:
It has a handful of limitations from what I recall.
from brett miller to everyone:
yeah in this instance as it's effectively hitting an API then the background local jobs makes sense

from Kevin Laux to everyone:
was there anyone online that wanted to share?
from brett miller to everyone:
I've been playing with Az Functions local debugging which is interesting but probably not a lightning talk :D
from Jonathan Moss to everyone:
Brett show off your twitch module!
from Kevin Laux to everyone:
one mans playing around is another mans lightning talk?
from brett miller to everyone:
yeah, playing around is deploying 3 az functions in an app service which will be using event grid eventually
from StevenJ to everyone:
Line 19: why not output the PSCustomObject to the success stream at this point. That way, any errors would not break the entire output of results.
from Jonathan Moss to everyone:
^^
from brett miller to everyone:
I have an Az Function Demo from a previous meetup
from StevenJ to everyone:
Why not put "PD" on the end of your production server names so the length of your server names are the same length?
from StevenJ to everyone:
Yes
from Francisco Navarro to everyone:
great talk on Azure Functions Brett!
from brett miller to everyone:
Cheers man, bit last minute :D
