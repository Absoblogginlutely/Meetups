https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/master/Functions/It.ps1#L247

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
The idea is for each test to read in an english like way

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
It "does some thing that I expect" { "some thing" | should -be "what i expect }

from Stephen Valdinger to everyone:
Mocking is awesome when you don't have a module that your code relies on

from Stephen Valdinger to everyone:
Looking at you AD module in Azure Pipelines

from Jason Milczek to everyone:
If you mock everything, seems like this would be useless.

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
Yeah you need to be careful

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
The general idea is to mock away cmdlets in your code that might be destructive where you don't want them to be

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
and then use assert-mockcalled to validate that that cmdlet was used (and therefore that your code got to and executed that step) without it really doing anything

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
it doesn't just have to be destructive cmdlets tho, you can mock away anything that you want to check ran without running, or as Jonathan has shown, where you want or need to create fixed outputs

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
important for cmdlets/functions that serve as input to your code.

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
The end result is usually that you end up testing the logic of your code in this way

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
e.g that it follows a certain path you expect when you run it with set input values

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
goes in to certain if blocks, or loops a number of times etc.

from Stephen Valdinger to everyone:
?regex and pester in the same talk

from Stephen Chu to everyone:
regexr.com to play with regex

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
now you have two problems :P

from Stephen Valdinger to everyone:
There was no warning at the front of this!

from Stephen Chu to everyone:
Compare-Object?

from Kevin Blumenfeld to everyone:
yes. thats very interesting!

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
I wrote a little generic server validator with Pester recently: https://github.com/markwragg/powershell-serverhealthcheck

from Mike Kanakos to everyone:
wow.. i need to check that out

from Mark Wragg to everyone:
Well done Jonathan, great session
