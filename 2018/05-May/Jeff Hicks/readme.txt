If you want to try the command in the demo file
you need the PSTeachingTools module. In a PowerShell
session run:

Import-Module PSTeachingtools

You may be prompted to install a new version of nuget
and to install from an untrusted repository. You should
be ok. Naturally, don't do this on a production server!
